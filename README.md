# ArduinoHorrorLight
This project comes from an idea born during halloween period.
The idea is simply a flickering light similar to the horror ones.

In order to make the project more versatile an AC dimmer has been implemented which is attached to an AC female socket. In this way it is possible to replace lamp of any kind or maybe multiple of it.

Finally an algorithm simulates the flickering light.

It is compleately programmable.
